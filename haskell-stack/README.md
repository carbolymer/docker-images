# Haskell Stack

Haskell Stack based on Debian Stretch suited for building Stack projects. What you need to do is to run `stack-build` inside project directory. If you'd like to pack binaries using `upx`, use `stack-static upx`. Generated binaries will be in the
`out/` directory.

# Tips

If you'd like to shorten build times and cache libraries downloaded and generated by stack, mount `/root/.stack` to your local filesystem or use as docker volume.
